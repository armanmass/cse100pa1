/*
 * IMPORTANT!! YOU MUST FORMAT PROMPTS AND OUTPUTS AS FOLLOWS: 
 *
 *      To output size of tree: 
 *          cout << "Size of tree: " << size << "\n"; 
 *
 *      To output height of tree: 
 *          cout << "Height of tree: " << height << "\n"; 
 *
 *      To prompt the user to enter a coordinate: 
 *          cout << "Enter coordinate (x y): " << "\n";
 *
 *      To output the result of the nearest neighbor search: 
 *          cout << "Nearest point in tree: " << nearestNeighbor << "\n"; 
 *
 *      To prompt the user to try again: 
 *          cout << "Search again? (y/n)" << "\n";
 *
 * Use cin to process user input.
 *
 * You MUST output size, then height, then prompt the user to search, as above.
 *
 * You MUST have the prompt for entering the name appear if and only if
 * the user input for trying again is "y" followed by the return key
 *
 * You MUST have the program exit (exiting the prompt loop) if and only if
 * the user input for trying again is "n" followed by the return key
 *
 * You should handle other inputs for the retry prompt,
 * but we will not be testing them.
 *
 * Note that size, height, and nearestNeighbor are local variables in main that
 * you should update accordingly.
